            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shopping</h1><p>Everyone familiar with RP will tell you to go to “Shack’s 5th Avenue”, but good luck finding it. We found it quite by accident taking a wrong turn one day. This is another great place to shop. It is located in a relatively new shopping district on Revolucion Ave.

The feel to “Shacks” is like a dusty, colorful, old time main street. The area is probably about four blocks long, on a wide street straddled by individual shops providing for room to walk and enjoying the Rocky Point shopping experience. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/02ed98245b5520c81ab989435421d10847d76d03.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Weather</h1><h2></h2><p>Much like the rest of the southwest, the climate in Peñasco is characterized by average temps in the 50-100 degree range, depending on season, and is marked by seasonal storms and high-weather seasons.

The Sonoran region in general - being a desert situated next to an ocean/source of humidity, yet pockmarked with areas of high elevation change - is characterized by temperature swings that can make the nights unseasonably cold compared to the day's blistering heat. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f39d94814f8c0fad14c629a54cd4eb5a846a2e95.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Whale Watching]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Whale Watching</h1><p>Looking for an excuse to visit beautiful Rocky Point? How about to catch sight of majestic whales in the turquoise colored Sea of Cortez?! That is correct; Humpback Whales and Grey Whales take up temporary residence in the Sea of Cortez to bear their young in the winter. From January to March the Sea beacons the large mammals because of the warm waters, which create the perfect environment for the whales to give birth.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2a457a13f793b10cbcd1335f1465cc15bdab75c6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
