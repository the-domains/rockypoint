            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shopping</h1><p>Everyone familiar with RP will tell you to go to “Shack’s 5th Avenue”, but good luck finding it. We found it quite by accident taking a wrong turn one day. This is another great place to shop. It is located in a relatively new shopping district on Revolucion Ave.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2b105917ffd0ee1db8b8d6bb1cb2e38da7c203c5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Weather</h1><h2>How is the weather in Rocky Point?</h2><p>Much like the rest of the southwest, the climate in Peñasco is characterized by average temps in the 50-100 degree range, depending on season, and is marked by seasonal storms and high-weather seasons.

The Sonoran region in general - being a desert situated next to an ocean/source of humidity, yet pockmarked with areas of high elevation change - is characterized by temperature swings that can make the nights unseasonably cold compared to the day's blistering heat. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c30ab4bf95b5250f4f1991139b980d2110083572.jpg"></article>]]></description>
