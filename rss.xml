            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1></h1><p>The feel to “Shacks” is like a dusty, colorful, old time main street. The area is probably about four blocks long, on a wide street straddled by individual shops providing for room to walk and enjoying the Rocky Point shopping experience. Sandy Beach is a short drive away and parking is very convenient. It is less crowded than the shrimp market shopping district, although certainly it is not as entertaining. There is no one shouting at you to come into their store like in the fish market. There are no restaurants, but you will find a few farmacias that sell drinks and snacks. It appears that most of the shops are built in front of private residences of the shop owners. You’ll find everything from sterling silver jewelry to high end artwork. Venders selling purses, swim suits, sun glasses, and pottery so be prepared to negotiate. No reason to pay the stated price. At Shack on 5th you can find water rafts for the kids, home furnishing for your house, or even convenient stores for bottled water on a humid day and beer for that evenings party.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2b105917ffd0ee1db8b8d6bb1cb2e38da7c203c5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
