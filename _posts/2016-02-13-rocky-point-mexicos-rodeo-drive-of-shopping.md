# Rocky Point, Mexico's Rodeo Drive of Shopping

Everyone familiar with RP will tell you to go to "Shack's 5th Avenue", but good luck finding it. We found it quite by accident taking a wrong turn one day. This is another great place to shop. It is located in a relatively new shopping district on Revolucion Ave.

The feel to "Shacks" is like a dusty, colorful, old time main street. The area is probably about four blocks long, on a wide street straddled by individual shops providing for room to walk and enjoying the Rocky Point shopping experience. Sandy Beach is a short drive away and parking is very convenient. It is less crowded than the shrimp market shopping district, although certainly it is not as entertaining. There is no one shouting at you to come into their store like in the fish market. There are no restaurants, but you will find a few farmacias that sell drinks and snacks. It appears that most of the shops are built in front of private residences of the shop owners. You'll find everything from sterling silver jewelry to high end artwork. Venders selling purses, swim suits, sun glasses, and pottery so be prepared to negotiate. No reason to pay the stated price. At Shack on 5th you can find water rafts for the kids, home furnishing for your house, or even convenient stores for bottled water on a humid day and beer for that evenings party.

For jewelry we like Nacho's place, he'll give you a good deal and has a good selection. If you are in need of sun glasses check out the only exclusive sun glass shop on the strip. Wide selection. Make sure you don't pay too much. Shack's is where Lupe, "the purse lady" is located. She has the best "designer purses" in town according to most aficionados. For the finer way's of life, check out the artisan and pottery shops on Shacks. If you look enough you can find really good deals on high quality art work and home furnishings. Everything from lamps, to candles, to lighted sculptures, hand turned pottery can be found. There are of couple nice art galleries and home furnishing stores you should visit. The Kokopelli art gallery has original pieces you cannot find anywhere else. This is art you will place as a conversation piece in your home.

There are a few American shop owners in this area. One American couple owns a pottery shop on the western end of the strip. And for reasonably priced Cuban Cigars visit Clay at The Friendly Shop right across the street. He has a good selection of Cohibas and Monte Cristos both in 5 and 25 cigar boxes. Quality is OK, but if you're a regular you can negotiate a good price. While you're shopping for your Cubans have a free shot of home made tequila and your significant other can shop for purses.
