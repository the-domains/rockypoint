Whale Watching SeasonLooking for an excuse to visit beautiful Rocky Point? How about to catch sight of majestic whales in the turquoise colored Sea of Cortez?!

From January to March the Sea beacons the large mammals because of the warm waters, which create the perfect environment for the whales to give birth.
