**How is the weather in Rocky Point, you ask?**

Much like the rest of the southwest, the climate in Pe√±asco is characterized by average temps in the 50-100 degree range, depending on season, and is marked by seasonal storms and high-weather seasons.

The Sonoran region in general - being a desert situated next to an ocean/source of humidity, yet pockmarked with areas of high elevation change - is characterized by temperature swings that can make the nights unseasonably cold compared to the day's blistering heat.

From_January to May_- 'Spring' - you can expect an average of 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit.

From_May to August_- 'Summer' - you can expect 80 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Summer days can be uncomfortably hot as the humid air and heat combine into a sweltering climate.

From_August to Dec_- 'Fall/Winter' - you can expect 60-75 an average degrees Fahrenheit, with rain more likely during this stretch of the year.

The Sonoran region's summer rains are typically short and heavy - 'monsoons' that can wash out desert roads and uproot trees. Winter rains tend to be longer, lighter, more widespread and less dangerous.
