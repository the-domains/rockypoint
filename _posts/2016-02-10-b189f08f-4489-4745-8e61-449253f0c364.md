## How is the weather in Rocky Point?

Much like the rest of the southwest, the climate in Pe√±asco is characterized by average temps in the 50-100 degree range, depending on season, and is marked by seasonal storms and high-weather seasons.
The Sonoran region in general - being a desert situated next to an ocean/source of humidity, yet pockmarked with areas of high elevation change - is characterized by temperature swings that can make the nights unseasonably cold compared to the day's blistering heat.
